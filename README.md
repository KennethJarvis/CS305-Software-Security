# CS305-Software-Security

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  As an employee at Global Rain, my client Artemis Financial is asking how to best protect their data along with their client's. They are a financial consulting company that develops financial plans for retirement, incestments, and savings. Artemis wants secure communication setup with their client that adds file verification in the transmission. 

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I felt the identifiing true vulnerabilities compared to flase positives was a strong point in my project's course. Focusing on the actual security risks helps our code be as secure as possible. It limits the avenues an attacker can take to penetrate the system.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
     Getting the overall software to work together was the most challenging. When updating dependancies, I found it sometimes caused problems that then needed to be addressed. It felt like that fixing one problem started another for a time. But when the last item was fixed, there were no further problems.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

     I found that addressing the most critical vulnerabilities at first helped increase the overall security. I was introduced to the CVE database in this course, and I found it helpful and I will be using it in future projects to ensure security has been addressed.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

     I used static and dynamic testing to make certain the code and software were functional and secure. After refactoring, I re-ran the security tests and checked for differences.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
     Maven dependency checker was a huge help in keeping my software up-to-date. It automatically solved many problems after the update was completed. I had assurance in that my software was protected from many risks known to be a problem.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I might show my GitHub account and the problems I faced in school. It will detailed how I overcame obstacles and what I have learned when I finding the solutions.
